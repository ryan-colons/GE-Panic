# GE-Panic
Competitive local multiplayer ball rolling game

Let's make a little game you guys!

### Getting Started

* Download Git GUI here https://git-scm.com/downloads (or try the desktop client if you want https://desktop.github.com/)
* Install Unity
* From the Git client, clone this repo (https://github.com/rycoll/GE-Panic) to a folder (probably in your Documents, I think that's where Unity looks for projects?)
* Now you can load up the project in Unity!
* Before making any changes, Remote>Fetch From>origin and Merge>Local Merge. This pulls any changes that someone else might have made.
* After making changes, press Rescan (so it can figure out what you've changed), then select the changes you want to publish and press Stage To Commit in the Commit menu up the top. Then, type in a commit message (brief summary of what you changed) and hit commit. Then press push, to publish everything you've committed.

### Gameplay

Players are balls on a little arena. Players can move into each other, with the goal of knocking each other off the arena.

Players have a "boost" ability which allows them to zoom forward, to knock other players, or to get out of the way. It's the "Panic" minigames from Crash Bash basically.
