# GE-Panic
Competitive local multiplayer ball rolling game

Let's make a little game you guys!

### Getting Started

* Download Github for Unity here https://github.com/github-for-unity/Unity/releases/tag/v0.16-alpha
* Install Unity
* Open up a Unity project and run the Github-For-Unity package to import it
* Put the url of this repo (https://github.com/rycoll/GE-Panic/) in the repo field and Pull
* Hopefully that'll work. It seems to be a bit buggy? (otherwise "git pull" on the command line might work?)
* When you want to push, go to the command line (via the Github menu at the top) and type "git push -u origin master" (no quotes)
  * I got an error doing this, but just disable lfs with the command it suggests and retry

### Gameplay

Players are balls on a little arena. Players can move into each other, with the goal of knocking each other off the arena.

Players have a "boost" ability which allows them to zoom forward, to knock other players, or to get out of the way. It's the "Panic" minigames from Crash Bash basically.
